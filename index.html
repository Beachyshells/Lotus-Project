      <p>
        Like the lotus, you are made for transformation. No matter how deep the
        waters or how tangled the roots, you rise—unfolding with grace,
        untouched by the mud that tried to hold you. Your journey is not defined
        by where you began but by the brilliance of your bloom, a testament to
        resilience, patience, and quiet strength. Even in the most uncertain
        moments, trust that you are growing, reaching toward the light. You are
        the lotus—rooted in challenge but destined for beauty.
